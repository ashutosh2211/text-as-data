LEAD: To the Editor: To the Editor: Most accounts of the Iran-contra connection ascribe various motives for the National Security Council sale of weapons to Iran - to improve U.S.-Iran relations, to support moderate elements in Iran, to free U.S. hostages in Lebanon - and treat the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan contras as incidental or as an afterthought. But what if N.S.C. officials sold arms to Iran with the primary purpose of raising funds for use in Nicaragua? This interpretation appears consistent with N.S.C. attempts to raise funds for the contras (e.g., from Brunei) and with the fact that Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the central figure in the affair, had responsibility primarily for Nicaraguan, not Iranian affairs. M. D.
