On May 25th, 2011, Mr. Tully will be recognized by the President, Chairman of the Board, and Board of Directors of the Flushing Savings Bank for his 44 years of tireless and dedicated service to the Bank and the Flushing Community.
After graduating from Hofstra College in 1950, Mr. Tully set to work in the construction industry, working for numerous businesses and creating countless jobs in the Queens and Long Island communities. In 1967, he joined the Flushing Savings Bank as a trustee. From 1981 through 1989, he served as the chief executive officer, and from 1980 until 2011, he was chairman of the board. His retirement as chairman on February 15th marks the end of an era for the Flushing bank. His decades of experience and wealth of knowledge have made him an invaluable asset for the bank and the customers it serves. Moving forward, he will continue his distinguished service as a member of the board.
Mr. Tully's success was not just confined to the realm of the business. For decades, he has been an active participant in a diverse group of community organizations. His support of Catholic Charities and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation deserves special recognition. Mr. Tully's active participation and skilled leadership in a variety of charitable endeavors has changed countless lives for the better. Mr. Tully's legacy of selfless devotion to community service is something in which his wife, Frances, and their 17 grandchildren and five great grandchildren can take great pride.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to count Mr. Tully among my constituents in the 5th Congressional District of New York. He has stepped down as the Chairman of the Board of the Flushing Savings Bank after having contributed immeasurably his community. I am proud to recognize Mr. Tully and I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking him for a lifetime of selfless dedication to the community.

Regrettably, Evelyn passed away earlier this week.
To say that Evelyn believed in giving back and paying forward would be an understatement--she devoted her entire life to helping the most vulnerable members of our society. The daughter of Polish immigrants, Evelyn worked hard to achieve the American Dream, graduating first from Brooklyn College and then going on to receive a Masters degree from Columbia University. Evelyn used her education and training to help others by becoming a certified psychiatric social worker in New York State.
During World War II and its aftermath, she helped veterans and their families cope with the psychiatric issues of war and also assisted children with respiratory ailments. During her four-decade long career as a social worker, she was a stalwart advocate for patients, assisting thousands of them at Jamaica, Long Island Jewish and North Shore hospitals. She was also the director of Long Term Care Ombudservice, Nassau County, safeguarding the rights of nursing-home residents and helping families deal with the difficult transition of placing loved ones into elder-care facilities.
Always the ardent activist, Evelyn was involved with many social agencies and organizations dedicated to assisting low income and vulnerable individuals, including: the Nassau Action Coalition, helping the aged and disabled and blind on Social Security Income; the Kimmel Housing Development Foundation, advocating for affordable housing; and the Social Action Committee of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck, serving as its chairperson. Evelyn also received numerous honors for her good works during her long and varied career, including: the American Jewish Congress Woman of the Year award, the Nassau County Social Worker of the Year award, and Nassau County Senior Citizen of the Year award.
Evelyn met the love of her life, Jack Weinstein, while she was attending Brooklyn College. They married in 1946 after Jack's service in the U.S. Navy and had three sons, Seth, Michael, and Howard. Jack went on to become a federal district judge, then chief judge, in the Eastern District of New York. But before Jack could become one of the most distinguished jurists in the country, Evelyn worked nights as a social worker and helped care for their young son so that Jack could attend Columbia University law school.
Evelyn was known for a lifetime of selfless devotion to her family, friends, coworkers, patients and clients. Her human touch and empathy for those in need led to the bettering of thousands of lives, not just through her own work, but also through her efforts of teaching people how to help people. She trained and supervised hundreds of social workers and volunteer ``ombudspeople'' along the way so that they could continue to ``pay forward'' what Evelyn had ``given back'' to her community. Evelyn was deeply committed to the concept of citizen representatives overseeing and engaging in government programs in their communities.
Mr. Speaker, Evelyn's energy and compassion for helping the disadvantaged never wavered, never flagged. She is already sorely missed, but her gift of helping others, as well as inspiring all of us to help those less fortunate than us, will always endure. I ask all of our colleagues to rise and join me in honoring Evelyn Weinstein. ","http://capitolwords.org/date/2012/06/06/E999-2_honoring-and-celebrating-the-life-of-evelyn-weinst/"

Tragically, two constituents from my congressional district perished due to Superstorm Sandy hitting the New York area. While unfortunately many people lost property, or lost power due to Sandy, we cannot forget that many people and their families lost much, much more: they lost their lives and their loved ones. These people were just in the wrong place at the wrong time--a minute or two earlier or later, a foot or two closer or farther--and perhaps their lives would not have been tragically cut short. They were our neighbors, our friends, our brothers, our sisters; they were part of our community.
Anthony Laino was in his home in Flushing, waiting out the storm in his bedroom when a tree fell onto his home, taking his life. Tony, as his friends and family called him, was only 30 years old and a graduate student at St. John's University. He had his whole life to live; friends and family described Tony as larger than life, a ``pillar of Flushing.'' His family and friends will truly miss him as they grapple with their unspeakable loss.
Safar Shafinoori of Roslyn was just moving his car. Just as any of us would have that night of the storm. Heartbreakingly, a falling tree struck and killed him. My heart goes out to Mr. Shafinoori's family.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of colleagues join me and rise in remembrance of Anthony Laino and Safar Shafinoori. They will be missed by their family, friends and our entire community.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2012/11/16/E1794-4_in-memory-of-anthony-laino-and-safar-shafinoori-vi/"

I am quite proud that the nation's leading organization working to raise awareness of Marfan syndrome and support the Marfan community, the National Marfan Foundation, is located in my congressional district, in Port Washington, New York. The NMF was founded in 1981 by Priscilla Ciccariello, a woman of tremendous compassion and vision. Since then, NMF members and staff have worked tirelessly to improve the lives of individuals affected by Marfan syndrome and related connective-tissue disorders by advancing research, raising awareness, and providing support.
Marfan syndrome is a rare genetic condition that affects connective tissue in the human body. About one in 5,000 Americans carries a mutation in the fibrillin gene. This irregularity results in an overproduction of a protein called transforming growth factor beta or TGFB. Increased TGFB impacts connective tissue throughout the entire body. Patient symptoms often include disproportionately long limbs, a protruding or indented chest bone, curved spine, and loose joints. Of most concern is thoracic aortic disease, which is when a Marfan patient's aorta, the large artery that carries blood away from the heart, is weakened and can result in a fatal rupture. It is for this reason that increased awareness of Marfan syndrome can save lives.
While there is no cure for Marfan syndrome, research is underway to enhance our understanding of the condition and improve patient care. I commend the scientists at the National Institutes of Health, particularly the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases for their research efforts in this regard. I encourage NIH to continue to expand its research of Marfan syndrome.
Early diagnosis and proper treatment are the keys to successfully managing Marfan syndrome so that patients can live a full life. I am pleased to announce that recently the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released new treatment guidelines for thoracic aortic disease. We can facilitate proper treatment by raising awareness of these guidelines and we can help achieve an early diagnosis by raising awareness of Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders.
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in raising awareness by observing Marfan Awareness Month.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2012/02/29/E277-2_recognizing-february-as-national-marfan-awareness-/"

and Panama Free Trade Agreements.
Mr. Speaker, global leadership is not attained with mere rhetoric; it 
is achieved, preserved and strengthened by demonstrating a commitment 
to action. Today, as the U.S. economy struggles through a prolonged 
period of slow-growth, our economic competitors are proactively engaged 
in eliminating or reducing barriers to their exports in foreign markets 
around the globe, especially in Asia and Latin America. If America 
intends to remain a global leader we cannot disengage from our critical 
strategic partnerships with Korea, Colombia and Panama.
Mr. Speaker, decades ago the U.S.-Korean partnership was forged on 
the battlefield. Soldiers from both of our nations fought and died 
together defending the freedom of the Korean people. Over the years, 
our relationship has flourished and Korea is now one of America's most 
trusted allies in the world. A vote for this trade agreement is a 
representation of America's ironclad commitment to Korea's future 
and a clear demonstration of our enduring friendship with the Korean 
people.
Colombia and Panama are two of the United States' most critical 
allies in Latin America. With our help, and aided by their own 
determination, these two countries have made remarkable progress. Mr. 
Speaker, these two trade deals will build upon the investments that we 
have already made in these two countries. Colombia has demonstrated--
with concrete actions--a genuine commitment to protecting its own 
people from violence. The rapidly expanding Panama remains a critical 
strategic partner and a literal gateway to maritime commerce in the 
Pacific. These new trade deals demonstrate America's long-term 
commitment to Colombia and Panama.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support these Free Trade 
Agreements.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/10/13/E1846-3_in-support-of-the-free-trade-agreements-hr-3078-hr/"

An ``unorthodox Orthodox Synagogue,'' the Chabad of Port Washington's membership is a conglomeration of Jews from a wide array of ages, backgrounds, and levels of observance. This diverse membership creates a welcoming atmosphere rich in culture and accessible to every corner of the Jewish community. The Chabad's unrivaled religious and educational experiences provide a forum for individuals of disparate backgrounds to come together as a single, unified congregation.
The Chabad's mission focuses on bringing to life traditional Jewish values to promote spiritual growth in a way that is both enjoyable and easy to understand. It is dedicated to promoting wisdom, comprehension, and knowledge of Judaism to both the membership and the broader community. The Chabad provides not only classes focused on a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Torah, but educational opportunities for young Jews experiencing their first exposure to the joys of Hebrew School. This approach to education allows the Chabad to reach out to a broad swatch of Jews and create the best opportunities for spiritual growth.
Tonight, the Chabad celebrates its 20 years of good works and pays special tribute to some of the individuals who have made it possible. Adam Katz, the President of the Chabad's board of directors, will have a new athletic center dedicated in his honor. The celebration also will recognize John Maura, Jr. with the Community Service Award; Chaim (Bryan) Sherman and Dr. Orly Calderon-Sherman with the Community Builders Award; and Alan Schoenfeld with the Chesed Award. Without the contributions of these extraordinary individuals, as well as many others, the exceptional achievements of the Chabad would not be possible.
Mr. Speaker, since 1991, the Chabad of Port Washington has been working tirelessly to educate, enlighten, and support its local community. I am proud to recognize the extraordinary dedication and accomplishments of the Chabad and I ask my colleagues join me in thanks and gratitude for its two decades of tremendous work supporting the community and promoting Jewish faith.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/04/08/E679-3_in-recognition-of-the-20th-anniversary-of-the-chab/"

Just this month, Mr. Kathwari received yet another prestigious honor, as the United States Institute of Peace, USIP, dedicated the Farooq Kathwari Amphitheater in recognition of both his long standing work with USIP, as well as his decades of humanitarian efforts across the globe. Not only has Farooq enjoyed a long and illustrious business career, but throughout his life he has also dedicated himself unfalteringly to numerous humanitarian causes. I have always marveled at the way he balances such a successful business career with his commitment to giving back and ``paying it forward.'' Farooq Kathwari is a most fitting recipient of this singular honor from USIP. While leading a Fortune 500 company, he generously lends his valuable time and energy to promote world peace through advocacy and by serving on the boards of numerous human- rights organizations.
The life story of Farooq Kathwari illustrates what our great country stands for, and the bountiful opportunities the United States offers its citizens. Farooq Kathwari came to America over 40 years ago as a political refugee from strife-torn Kashmir, and he now leads one of the Nation's largest and prestigious companies. He arrived in New York City at age 20 armed with a B.A. in English and political science, and with a determination to live and grow in a free society. Two years later he earned an MBA, went to work for Newcourt Securities, where he rapidly rose to the position of vice president, and simultaneously launched his own importing business. Soon thereafter, the iconic American company, Ethan Allen, purchased an interest in his company. In 1980, the firms merged, and Farooq Kathwari became vice president of Ethan Allen. By 1989, he had risen to the post of Chairman, President, and CEO. Farooq has been the top executive at Ethan Allen Interiors for 26 years; under his leadership, the company has become a leading competitor in interior design and home furnishings, while also fostering a business that values environmental and social responsibility. He is a national leader in the furniture industry; where he serves as the director and chairman of the National Retail Federation and director and is the former chairman and president of the American Home Furnishings Alliance. The industry also inducted him into the American Furniture Hall of Fame.
While Farooq's professional accomplishments are impressive, his most laudable contribution is his tireless dedication to foster world peace and to bettering the lives of others. His humanitarian efforts extend to those people displaced by conflict zones and who end up in refugee camps, and to those facing religious persecution in the Middle East and elsewhere. Most recently, Farooq was honored by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees for his steadfast dedication to raising consciousness of the plight of refugees worldwide. He also serves on the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and has received numerous awards for his peace activism, including the humanitarian award from the Anti-Defamation League. Farooq is a director and former chairman of Refugees International, a director of the International Rescue Committee, director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University and the Henry L. Stimson Center, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He is also my friend.
Mr. Speaker, Farooq's life's work is to help foster a dialogue for peace in much-troubled regions, and to promote human rights around the world. I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to stand and join me now in honoring Farooq Kathwari, a most compassionate and selfless citizen. May his good works serve as a model for countless others to follow.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/12/20/E2332-2_in-recognition-of-the-career-and-humanitarian-achi/"

Since the late 1500s, the Jewish people of Latvia have demonstrated incredible perseverance and courage through inconceivable trials and persecutions. As we reflect on this milestone anniversary, let us remember their history and celebrate their future.
The first Jewish settlements in Latvia appeared in the late 16th century. Through steady immigration, expansion, and steadfast resilience, the community grew and spread across the country. As the Jewish population expanded, they contributed immeasurably to the economic, industrial, and cultural development of Latvia. These accomplishments came despite frequently being forced to cope with anti-Semitic laws and cultural prejudice. By the late 1930s, approximately 93,000 Latvian Jews were living and prospering in the country.
In the summer of 1941, Nazi troops occupied Latvia. Within days of the occupation, the Nazis issued special decrees restricting Jewish rights and establishing ghettos. Jews from surrounding countries were forcibly transported to Latvian camps. Tens of thousands were murdered.
By the conclusion of World War II, tragically, only 14,000 Latvian Jews remained. In the years after, Jews from surrounding regions relocated in Latvia--rebuilding their community to more than 36,000 people. In the aftermath of the greatest evil ever perpetrated against a people, the Latvian Jews marched on--restoring their culture and society, fighting against the oppression of Soviet rule. Latvia became one of the centers of Zionist dissidence and Jewish national movements in the Soviet Union. Jewish activists struggled for the right to immigrate to Israel and to openly honor the memory of Holocaust victims. Thousands emigrated to Israel, the United States and Western Europe.
Today, the Latvian Jewish community of 13,000 is experiencing a rebirth. On this, their 450th anniversary, the Jews of Latvia can look back on their history with a solemn pride. Having suffered through terrible hardship, the Latvian Jewry is rebuilding its religious and social life--revitalizing the community's enduring spirit.
I would like to extend special recognition to the Latvian Council of Jewish Communities and the United States Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad for organizing the extremely successful memorial project at Riga, Latvia's oldest Jewish cemetery. Under the leadership and guidance of Chairman Warren Miller and Commissioner Lee Seeman, the memorial at the Old Jewish Cemetery reminds the world of the tragedy of the Jews killed during World War II and asks us to strive for a better future. I am proud to celebrate the Latvian Jewish community's historic anniversary. I ask all my colleagues to join me in recognizing their past perseverance and achievements, and in extending our sincere best wishes for their future success and prosperity.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/06/22/E1164_recognizing-the-450th-anniversary-of-the-latvian-j/"

Over the course of her almost 40-year professional career with Jewish Community Centers (JCC) in New York City and Long Island, Susan worked tirelessly to ensure that families and individuals living in New York City and Long Island had access to mental-health and social-service programs. She has not only been an innovative leader and unyielding advocate for individuals with disabilities, but also a dedicated leader in her community.
After graduating from Brooklyn College with a degree in speech pathology, Susan began working at JCCs with distinction. She started her career at the Staten Island Jewish Community Center as the Director of Early Childhood Development. In 1988, she moved to be the Executive Director at the Young Men's-Young Women's Hebrew Association in Westchester, New York. Then, in 1992, Susan became the Executive Director of the Sid Jacobson Jewish Community Center in East Hills, New York, in my congressional district.
Under Susan's enthusiastic direction, Sid Jacobson has flourished. The Center dramatically expanded its facility in East Hills and also added the Bernice Jacobson Day School and Camp in Old Westbury, New York. Susan developed the Center's noted innovative programs for autistic children, single parents, and the bereaved. She helped found a first-of-its-kind program for adults with early-onset Alzheimer's and their families.
Today, the Center has a staff of over 250, an annual budget of $12 million, and offers an extensive catalog of dynamic programs for people of all ages and abilities. The success of the Center is a direct testament to the strength of Susan's leadership and her dedication to providing community members with the best possible services.
In addition to her work at Sid Jacobson, Susan has applied her energy and vision in a variety of leadership roles in the national JCC movement. She served as a member of the Jewish Community Center Association's board of directors, was president of the Association of Jewish Center Professionals (AJCP) for the Eastern Region, and, in 2002, was named the national president of the AJCP.
Mr. Speaker, this year Susan Bender will retire having contributed immeasurably to her community.

Born on February 24, 1911, in Bronx, New York, Bee grew up with a deep love and appreciation for her family, community and country. Forced to obtain employment as a teenager due to the loss of her father, she secured a job with a women's coat manufacturer at the age of 16 to help support her family, while also excelling as a champion amateur handball player. Five years later, she married her boss, Max Cohen, and continued to work by his side for more than 50 years. Bee and Max raised two sons, Joseph and Ronald.
Friends and family of Bee would tell you that she always looks at the good in people. Her uplifting attitude is contagious, and has spread to her family, friends and neighbors--many of whom, and their parents, were not even born when Bee moved into her current apartment on the West Side of Manhattan shortly after World War II.
In Bee's 100 years, she has lived through some of the most precariously challenging, exultant and remarkable eras. Yet, she has always kept up with the culture of the times.

Gross for his exceptional military service to the United States during World War II. On May 25th, 2011, the Honor Flight program will recognize Dr. Gross along with other World War II veterans at the World War II Memorial in Washington, DC for answering the call of service to our country in a time of dire peril.
In 1942, when his country needed him, Dr. Gross did not hesitate--he left his private dental practice and immediately joined the Army medical corps. In the service, he went above and beyond his assigned duties, demonstrating extraordinary patriotism and a tireless commitment to service. He was recognized for his outstanding achievements and promoted to Captain before his honorable discharge in 
Dr. Gross was initially stationed stateside in Wyoming at Ft. Francis E. Warren. He then transferred to Camp Phillips in Salina, Kansas where, in addition to his regular duties in the dental clinic, he was a bivouac officer. In 1943, Dr. Gross was sent overseas to treat enlisted personnel and officers, as well as supervise the set-up, personnel, and day-to-day operations of dental laboratories based in England, France, and Germany.
Once stationed in England, Dr. Gross witnessed the devastating blitzkrieg of London which literally shook the Cumberland hotel where he was billeted with other military personnel. He vividly recalls witnessing, on D-Day, the swarms of American planes flying over Grimm's Ditch near Stonehenge in route to Germany. He remembers the sky appearing black as a seemingly never-ending wave of warplanes and airplanes towing gliders headed toward their appointed bombing mission.
The momentousness of the events in which Dr. Gross and the other servicemen and women took place cannot be overstated. Quite simply, they saved the world. We owe them a debt that can never be repaid.
Dr. Gross completed his tour of duty in 1946 and returned to the United States, where he resumed his private practice until he retired in 1990 at age 75. He is currently living in St. Louis and will turn 97 on this July 4th--a date which uniquely symbolizes his enduring love for his country.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Dr. Gross for his tremendous patriotism and courage during such an important moment in history. I ask my colleagues to join me now in thanking him for his service to his country. ","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/05/13/E894-4_in-recognition-of-dr-byron-j-gross/"

Over the course of her almost 40-year professional career with Jewish Community Centers (JCC) in New York City and Long Island, Susan worked tirelessly to ensure that families and individuals living in New York City and Long Island had access to mental-health and social-service programs. She has not only been an innovative leader and unyielding advocate for individuals with disabilities, but also a dedicated leader in her community.
After graduating from Brooklyn College with a degree in speech pathology, Susan began working at JCCs with distinction. She started her career at the Staten Island Jewish Community Center as the Director of Early Childhood Development. In 1988, she moved to be the Executive Director at the Young Men's--Young Women's Hebrew Association in Westchester, New York. Then, in 1992, Susan became the Executive Director of the Sid Jacobson Jewish Community Center in East Hills, New York, in my congressional district.
Under Susan's enthusiastic direction, Sid Jacobson has flourished. The Center dramatically expanded its facility in East Hills and also added the Bernice Jacobson Day School and Camp in Old Westbury, New York. Susan developed the Center's noted innovative programs for autistic children, single parents, and the bereaved. She helped found a first-of-its-kind program for adults with early-onset Alzheimer's and their families.
Today, the Center has a staff of over 250, an annual budget of $12 million, and offers an extensive catalog of dynamic programs for people of all ages and abilities. The success of the Center is a direct testament to the strength of Susan's leadership and her dedication to providing community members with the best possible services.
In addition to her work at Sid Jacobson, Susan has applied her energy and vision in a variety of leadership roles in the national JCC movement. She served as a member of the Jewish Community Center Association's board of directors, was president of the Association of Jewish Center Professionals (AJCP) for the Eastern Region, and, in 2002, was named the national president of the AJCP.
Mr. Speaker, this year Susan Bender will retire having contributed immeasurably to her community. I am proud to recognize Susan and I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking her for her lifetime of tremendous work for others.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/04/05/E642-3_in-recognition-of-the-career-and-achievements-of-s/"

First, with all the conflict and frustration surrounding this vote, I'm reverting to basic principles. One of which is, ``don't negotiate with thugs.'' It's been long obvious that we have no partner with whom to negotiate; only a party that started as our comrades in government, then our colleagues, who evolved into our opponents, declared themselves our enemies and now demand that we be their enablers. I refuse to play.
Thugs are in the game to destroy, not build. They would destroy the government, and especially this presidency. They take hostages, and there is much work at stake that would be their next targets. It will be endless. The president has given into all of their demands, and they remain insatiable. It's time we starved the beast. Then . . .
They came to Washington they say committed not to do business as usual. Then they demanded that we protect every loophole, every billionaire and every greedy element in our society except those who need some help.
They set-up something that is their fail safe. I call it the ``Kevorkian Commission'' that will deliver the poison if in November, we don't volunteer to do it ourselves.
We Democrats in the House were not at the table, and we wind up on the menu.
There are arguments that are valid and good for voting ``aye.'' But I didn't come to this place to forget the homeless, the hapless and the hungry.
The most vulnerable in our society don't watch their 401K plan, the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the futures market. Their future is getting through till tomorrow. They are more concerned about having a roof than they are the national debt ceiling. They need jobs, nutrition, education and encouragement. The time we've spent on this debate would indicate that we've bought into the trickledown theory.
Here's what I know: the people I came here to help need real help. Their lives and future are really endangered. What happens to us people with portfolios, and Wall Street watchers is scary, but conjecture.
Sounds hokey, but I'm voting for what I came here to do.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/08/02/E1494-2_budget-control-act-of-2011/"

Tragically, Eugene passed away unexpectedly last month at the all too early age of 33.
Eugene devoted his too short life to his family and country. After graduating from Roslyn High School in 1996, he enlisted in the United States Navy. The military proved an ideal career choice. His intelligence, patriotism, selflessness, and drive to succeed in all he endeavored were a perfect fit for the Navy. It was no surprise to those who knew Eugene best that he would be highly decorated for his service. Eugene earned the Navy Achievement Medal, Blue Jacket Award, National Defense Service Medal, Joint Services Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal, Good Conduct Medal, Navy Pistol Expert Medal, and Rifleman Marksmanship Ribbon.
Following his time in the Navy, Eugene enrolled at Pennsylvania State University, where he studied security and risk analysis. It was Eugene's difficulty obtaining full-tuition benefits for his education under the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill that inspired him and his mother, Leslie Blei, to become tireless advocates of the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill Improvements Act. When the bill passed and was signed into law by President Obama, Eugene, selfless as always, cited his mother's advocacy as a factor for passage of the bill.
Eugene's professional accomplishments were numerous. His personal attributes were the most significant though. Eugene was loved by his family and loved them in return, including his partner Elizabeth Rockey. His large extended family was the source of his strength.
Eugene's life was cut short, but as his father Eugene Bonacci II says, Eugene was blessed with a meaningful life. In a final act of compassion that embodied Eugene's selflessness, he donated his organs, which doctors estimated could save and improve the lives of numerous people.
For his service to country, advocacy for veterans, and devotion to his family and friends, I ask all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in honoring Eugene Aaron Bonacci.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/03/02/E393-4_honoring-the-life-of-eugene-aaron-bonacci/"

The BKV Memorial Foundation has been instrumental in raising awareness and resources for individuals battling leukemia. The Foundation's creation was inspired by the remarkable life of one of my constituents, Bevin Kalathil Varughese--a life which was tragically cut short following an unsuccessful bout with this terrible disease.
Born in Manhasset, New York, Bevin Kalathil Varughese was an affectionate individual and a cherished son, brother, nephew, cousin, and uncle. An extraordinarily motivated young man, Bevin graduated from Herricks High School in New York and went on to earn his Bachelor's Degree in Finance and Real Estate from Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His cheerfulness, generosity, and love of life were evident to all who knew him; his personality touched all who were close to him.
Bevin's drive and good-nature were unwavering--even when he was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in January 2004 at the age of 24. Although Bevin fluctuated between relapse and remission for four years, he refused to let the disease dampen his spirits or weaken his will. Instead, Bevin focused his energy on researching the disease and the resources available to those it afflicts. By working with his family and friends, he created the South Asian Cancer Foundation (SACF) which advocates for leukemia awareness, particularly within the South Asian-American community. Bevin was also involved in a variety of other organizations dealing with the disease and those affected by it--he hosted fundraisers to benefit both the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS) and the SACF, took part in the LLS Light the Night Walk, and organized numerous blood and bone marrow drives.
Although Bevin eventually lost his battle with leukemia on February 7th, 2008 at the all-too-young age of 28, his passion and legacy live on through the Bevin Kalathil Varughese Memorial Foundation. The BKV Memorial Foundation was created in 2008 to both preserve Bevin's memory and to continue his work with the South Asian Cancer Foundation. The Foundation's mission is to raise awareness about acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other blood-related diseases. This non-profit organization provides resources to those suffering from leukemia and to their families. The assistance comes in the form of support for leukemia patients, financial aid for those who cannot afford treatment, and donations for research to find a cure for the disease. The BKV Foundation works tirelessly to raise funding through countless charity events and organizations. It has also reached out to the greater community by encouraging individuals to register with the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP).
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize the achievements and dedication of the Bevin Kalathil Varughese Memorial Foundation. Through its attempts to preserve and honor Bevin's memory, this Foundation is making a positive and lasting impact on countless lives. I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in recognition of the achievements of the Bevin Kalathil Varughese Memorial Foundation.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/03/11/E464_in-recognition-of-the-bevin-kalathil-varughese-mem/"

In the summer of 1951, approximately 70 Jewish families gathered with the hopes of establishing a place of worship for the Jewish community in Roslyn and the surrounding area. They could have hardly hoped or anticipated that these humble beginnings would grow into such a vibrant and vital temple--renowned for its excellent religious school, its benevolent activism, and its strong commitment to the Jewish faith and Jewish values.
In 1957, the still nascent congregation came together to raise funds to construct a new school wing, an atrium, offices, and a synagogue and sanctuary--facilities they still use today. Since then, the congregation has only continued to grow in both reach and mission. Temple Beth Sholom has been recognized for its extraordinary educational program--from nursery school to adult education. The Temple's Rabbi Ario S. and Tess Hyams Judaica Museum, founded in 1968, houses an impressive collection of art and artifacts important to Jews and the Jewish faith. The generous congregation has donated and raised funds to continually improve the function and facilities of the Temple. Moving forward, the congregation will continue to expand and improve its positive influence on both their membership and the community.
For decades, the Temple has maintained an unwavering fidelity to the values of the Conservative Jewish movement while encouraging both open-mindedness and innovative practices. Emblematic of this, Temple Beth Sholom elected its first woman president in 1972 and, in subsequent years, became one of the first egalitarian congregations in the Conservative movement. The Temple was also one of the first to collect congregational contributions according to a sliding scale based on income--recognizing diverse capabilities to give within their membership. Through innovation and creativity, Temple Beth Sholom has remained faithful to its Conservative tradition while embracing new and pioneering practices.
Under the current direction of Rabbi Alan B. Lucas, Temple Beth Sholom is continuing in its great tradition of faith, family, and community. His spiritual guidance is an invaluable asset to the congregation and the surrounding community, and his leadership and commitment will allow the Temple to continue its good works for years to come.
On June 12, 2011, Temple Beth Sholom will celebrate its 60th anniversary. Since 1951, it has been an essential element of the Roslyn Heights community. I am proud to recognize the synagogue's extraordinary accomplishments. I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing my gratitude and congratulations to Temple Beth Sholom for its six decades of service to the Jewish community of Roslyn.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/06/13/E1067-5_in-recognition-of-the-60th-anniversary-of-the-temp/"

Nettie was the political midwife to a generation of young politicians in New York. She spent decades working tirelessly for the people of Queens, and I know I speak for many when I say that her recent retirement from the Assembly has truly marked the end of an era. Nettie is being honored this week for her innumerable accomplishments over many years by the Stevenson Regular Democratic Club at its annual dinner, and I would like to join in recognizing the profound impact that my very dear and long-time friend, Nettie Mayersohn, has had on our community.
Nettie Mayersohn's steadfast dedication to Queens County began long before she was elected to the Assembly. For over 20 years, she served as a community activist, making a name for herself as an unrelenting advocate for children and families in Queens. She was a member of Community Board 8 for ten years, at one time serving as the Chairperson of its Youth Committee; she served as the Chairperson of the Pomonok Community Center; and she continues to serve as a Democratic District Leader, a role she has filled for some three decades. Nettie also served as the Executive Secretary of the New York State Crime Victims Board. In 1977, Nettie was New York State's delegate to the International Women's Conference and the recipient of the Builders of Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews. She received a B.A. from Queens College in 1978, and was elected four years later to represent the 27th District in the New York State Assembly.
As an Assemblywoman, Nettie led the charge to improve healthcare for New Yorkers and defend the rights of victims of violent crime. Nettie's proudest and best-known achievement was the 1996 passage of her Baby AIDS bill, which requires doctors in New York State to tell a mother if her newborn child is HIV-positive. While the fight to enact this bill was, at times, a lonely battle, Nettie's tenacity and fortitude resulted in a landmark law that has saved an untold number of lives and led to an increase in the number of pregnant women who receive prenatal care. Among Nettie's numerous other legislative accomplishments are her HIV Rape Law, which requires a court to comply with a rape victim's request to test the accused for HIV; her Partner Notification Law, which requires the names of those testing positive for HIV to be reported to the Department of Health for the purpose of contact tracing and partner notification; her Victim Impact Law, which allows the victims of a crime to describe, in court, the effect the crime has had on their lives; and her Food Service Law, which implemented crucial health safety measures for food service workers.
Nettie Mayersohn's unwavering commitment to AIDS policy inspired the Beyond AIDS Foundation to create the Nettie Award--an annual honor that recognizes outstanding efforts to promote HIV prevention and control in the United States and across the world. Nettie herself was given a special Nettie Award from Beyond AIDS in 2002, in recognition of her leadership on HIV/AIDS issues. That year, she also received the Public Service Award from the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.
After 28 years of tireless service, Nettie retired from the Assembly at the beginning of April 2011 so she can spend time more with her wonderful family. While I lament Nettie's retirement from an impressive career as a public servant, she will remain my lifelong friend. We are all beyond grateful for everything she has done to help New Yorkers. I wish her all the best in her retirement--she will be sorely missed in public life.
Mr. Speaker, Nettie Mayersohn is a one-of-a-kind leader and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing her accomplishments and thanking Nettie for a lifetime of dedication to her community.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/12/08/E2212-3_in-recognition-of-the-career-and-achievements-of-t/"

For 7 years now, the Department of Veterans Affairs has pursued a perhaps well-intentioned but a stubbornly wrongheaded plan for the St. Albans Primary and Extended Care facility which is located in the county of Queens. I am very concerned that the VA is proceeding full speed ahead with its plans to lease a property for 34 years, property currently dedicated exclusively for veterans. And what are the veterans supposed to do for the next 75 years without this facility, when there is a rising demand among our veterans for medical services?
The justification--you have to hear this--the justification for the VA's decision stems from an absurd outdated report that relied on data from 2003, 8 years ago, when we were only at the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have, unfortunately, seen tremendous increases in veterans homelessness, foreclosures, divorce, substance abuse, PTSD and, yes, suicides.
And yet the VA report from all those years ago projected at that time, almost a decade ago, that mental health services for our veterans was going to decrease over the next 20 years. It's been 8 years since that report. And what have we seen during the 8 years alone? And there's 12 years more to go. We've seen increases in all of these problems among our veterans. And yet they cling stubbornly to the data in that report, thinking that these things are going to go down among our veterans. And this, everybody knows, is certainly not going to be the case.
All evidence suggests that returning veterans are going to require a greater significant increase especially in VA mental health services. A Rand Center report alone found that already 18.5 percent of all U.S. servicemembers who have returned already from Afghanistan and Iraq currently suffer from PTSD or depression, and that 19.5 percent suffer from traumatic brain injury.
Where is the Veterans Administration's common sense? To give away this property, which is intended and secured right now for our veterans, is a huge mistake, based on a report that is already discredited by the facts. This is something that we can't allow to continue.
These are veterans who have sacrificed so much. We have to stand here today on the floor. And I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, colleagues in the majority especially, for seeing through the politics of this and understanding that these are our veterans that we are fighting for; that we, as Members of Congress, understand our constituencies and our needs and their needs.
I want to personally thank Representatives Grimm and King, who are among our delegation, as well as the rest of the Democratic members of the delegation in our region, and thank Representative Meeks for his dynamic and great leadership in bringing this to our attention so that we could stand together as patriotic Americans all, at least on this issue, and fight for the needs of our veterans.
I yield back the balance of my time.

It will irresponsibly and indefinitely delay the vital security improvements to the perimeter of the U.N. campus in the city that the State Department wants to undertake and has the resources to commit. Why do this? Only a radical, wild-eyed obsession with taking a pound of flesh out of the U.N., which at times deserves it, and to do so no matter what the cost to our national security.
Where is the common sense in clawing back money that is going to be used for desperately needed, long overdue security upgrades that we have the money for anyway and have the responsibility to do anyway? Where's the benefit to the taxpayer for maintaining the vulnerability of the most prominent international target which happens to be in al Qaeda's most highly targeted city?
I can see how the terrorists benefit from reduced security. But I'm having a terribly hard time seeing how New Yorkers or Americans or the 1 million tourists to the building or even the multitudes of international representatives at the United Nations, whom we have undertaken to keep safe, will benefit. The U.N.'s Capital Master Plan calls for $100 million in security upgrades.
As the host nation, that's something about which we should be proud. We are the guarantors of the U.N.'s physical security. We have the money in the Tax Equalization Fund that we can use for the security upgrades. The State Department has already committed to do it. The U.N. wants us to do it. New York City needs us to do it. The New York City Police Department is literally on its knees begging us to do it. We have the money. We don't need further appropriations. All we need to do is to stop this bizarre and radical effort to derail the whole effort.
And you want to eliminate $100 million in jobs? Why?
Security in New York is something I take very seriously. I think most Members do. But as this bill shows, some clearly don't. They are all too happy to rush to the floor every September 11 and boast about the amazing heroism of our police, our firefighters, our first responders. One day a year, they think New York City is part of America.
The rhetoric is all patriotism and bombast, full of promises to do ``whatever it takes.'' And then comes the time to start paying for it. And then, Madam Speaker, some Members have a change of heart. Proudly remembering 9/11 heroism for some Members was no impediment to telling workers deathly ill from their time on ``the pile'' to go ahead and die. Congress didn't have any money for them--at least not until the story got out.
Those of us from New York haven't forgotten all the so-called ``patriots'' who fought tooth and nail to stop the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. So now, instead of fighting to get Congress to do the minimally decent thing, we find ourselves on the floor of the House fighting to prevent Congress from doing the maximally stupid thing. I'm not sure this constitutes progress. Taking money from vital security upgrades is radical, irresponsible, and reckless. It's stupid.
Vote ``no'' on stupid.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/02/09/H563_united-nations-tax-equalization-refund-act-of-2011/"

LEVANDER","http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-08-01/html/CREC-2012-08-01-pt1-PgE1384-4.htm",116,"CREC-2012-08-01-pt1-PgE1384-4.chunk0",158,"Extensions",2,"Ackerman","E1384","D","2012-08-01","","A000022","Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the exceptional achievements and outstanding career of Seymour S. Levander. Sy, as his friends and family know him, will turn 89 years old later this year, is a beloved father and grandfather. Sy, the son of immigrant refugees from Europe, began his version of the American Dream growing up in the Bronx, graduating from James Madison High School in 1941. He continued his academic studies at Cooper Union University, graduating in 1944 and teaching electrical engineering there for a short time.
Sy then started designing and selling equipment for the building trade, which was booming at that time in post-war America. In the 1950s, Sy, seeing an opportunity, struck out on his own and started his own business which he owned and ran until he sold the firm at the age of 66 at his wife Ellenore's request. However, retirement didn't take with Sy, and he continued to work. At the tender young age of 71, he started a new engineering and sales firm with younger partners where he continues his storied career in the construction industry to this day, still going in to work at age 88. Sy's knowledge, work ethic, and old-fashioned integrity are the stuff of legend in the industry. Over the years, he has been honored several times by ASHRAE, the nationwide building technology society, as well as other industry organizations.
Sy has also been a terrific community leader and a fighter for the underdog throughout his life. Through his businesses and a lifetime of charitable endeavors, he has created opportunities for people from all walks of life and backgrounds. In addition, he and his beloved wife Ellenore, who unfortunately passed away this year after 67 years of marriage, were founders of the Pelham Jewish Center, which has been a primary focus of his energies and care for many years.
Mr. Speaker, while he has many achievements to his name, Sy is most proud of his two children, a doctor and a lawyer; his daughter-in-law, an architect; and his four grandchildren, who are, respectively, the first trumpet for the San Francisco Opera and a music professor at Berkley, a doctor interning at Stony Brook University Medical Center, a law student and Human Rights Fellow at Columbia University Law School, and a rising junior at Dartmouth College. I ask all of our colleagues to rise and join me in honoring Seymour S. Levander.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2012/08/01/E1384-4_in-recognition-of-the-career-and-achievements-of-s/"

These fine young men and women should be applauded for their dedication and hard work. Together, they spent over 2,300 hours participating in special projects, grassroots outreach, and community activities.
This organization has also had some outstanding leadership. Under the guidance of Republican State Executive Committee member Rebecca Branch, conservative teenagers in Cullman formed the Cullman Area Teenage Republican Club and found an avenue by which they could impact elections at all levels. Rebecca has been a shining example and has provided real leadership to these students over the years.
In addition, Daniel Robinson, a 2012 graduate of Cullman High School, has been recognized as the Most Outstanding Republican in the Nation. Daniel not only worked to increase membership in Cullman, but also helped start new Teen Republican Organizations in Baldwin, Shelby, Madison and Morgan counties. Daniel plans to continue his education at Auburn university this fall and looks forward to having the opportunity to work with Auburn's Young Republicans this fall.
These exceptional young people have worked diligently to recruit Alabama youth, involve them in the political process, and promote the understanding of the conservative philosophy. It is encouraging to see these young students from Alabama's Fourth District do such great things and I applaud them for their accomplishments.
Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to honor the members of the Cullman Area Teenage Republican Club for their achievement and unwavering resolution in building this organization for the conservative youth of Alabama. I join their family, friends, and colleagues in congratulating them on receiving this award.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2012/09/10/E1450_cullman-area-teenage-republican-club/"

As of today, Congress prohibits the expenditure of Federal funds on abortions through a patchwork of riders on our annual appropriations bills. These riders include the Hyde amendment in Labor-HHS and other prohibitions in the State and Foreign Operations bill, the Financial Services bill, the Commerce-Justice-Science bill, in addition to the Defense bill. Simply put, this legislation will eliminate the need for these annual riders to ensure that these policies become permanent statute.
This bill also codifies the Hyde-Weldon conscience clause that would expand the policy to include all recipients of Federal funds. The conscience clause protects health care entities that choose not to provide abortions from discrimination by State, local, or Federal agencies that receive Federal funds. Therefore, no one who has deep religious or moral opposition to abortions should be forced to provide for them.
Madam Speaker, I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.","http://capitolwords.org/date/2011/05/04/H3014-5_no-taxpayer-funding-for-abortion-act/"
