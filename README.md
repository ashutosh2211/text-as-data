## Text as Data

### Preprocess
Preprocess text for text-as-data analysis. Depending on the need, remove stop words, punctuation, capitalization, special characters, and stem.

One of the scripts takes a directory of 'raw' text files and outputs processed text files in the same directory structure. 
The other script takes a csv with 'raw' text and outputs a csv with processed text.
